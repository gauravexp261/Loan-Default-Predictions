This repository contains the solution for the "Predicting Customer Loan Default" challenge, aimed at addressing the critical issue of accurately predicting the likelihood of a customer defaulting on a loan. The challenge is designed to provide valuable insights for the banking, finance, insurance (BFSI), and fintech industries.

# Problem Statement
In today's financial landscape, accurate prediction of customer loan default is crucial for mitigating risk and maintaining a healthy lending portfolio. The participants in this challenge are tasked with developing machine learning models using provided credit history, payment behavior, and account details to determine the probability of a customer defaulting on a loan.

# Dataset
The dataset includes essential features such as credit history, payment behavior, and account details, offering a real-world scenario that reflects challenges faced by financial institutions. [Data set link](https://machinehack.com/hackathons/analytics_olympiad_2023/data)

Note that this dataset may not be reliable as this project was developed for educational purposes in the field of machine learning only and not for professional use.

A live version of the application can be found on [Streamlit Community Cloud](https://alejandro-ao-streamlit-cancer-predict-appmain-uitjy1.streamlit.app/). 

## Installation

To run the Loan-Fraud-Predictions locally, you will need to have Python 3.6 or higher installed. Then, you can install the required packages by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all the necessary dependencies, including Streamlit, OpenCV, and scikit-image.

## Usage
To start the app, simply run the following command:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

This will launch the app in your default web browser. You can then upload an image of cells to analyze and adjust the various settings to customize the analysis. Once you are satisfied with the results, you can export the measurements to a CSV file for further analysis.
